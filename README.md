# Chat-Bot-for-Customer-Support

Designing a semi rule based Chat-Bot to provide Customer Support 

DOMAIN: Customer support

CONTEXT: Great Learning has a an academic support department which receives numerous support requests every day throughout the
year. Teams are spread across geographies and try to provide support round the year. Sometimes there are circumstances where due to
heavy workload certain request resolutions are delayed, impacting company’s business. Some of the requests are very generic where a
proper resolution procedure delivered to the user can solve the problem. Company is looking forward to design an automation which can
interact with the user, understand the problem and display the resolution procedure [ if found as a generic request ] or redirect the request
to an actual human support executive if the request is complex or not in it’s database.

DATA DESCRIPTION: A sample corpus is given to us for reference. I have  enhanced more data to the corpus.

PROJECT OBJECTIVE: I have designed a python based interactive semi - rule based chatbot which can do the following:

1. Start chat session with greetings and ask what the user is looking for.
2. Accept dynamic text based questions from the user. Reply back with relevant answer from the designed corpus.
3. End the chat session only if the user requests to end else ask what the user is looking for. Loop continues till the user asks to end it.
